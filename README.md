Multiplayer destructive bingo for grownups

## Setup

On `config` folder it has two files called `dummy_dev.exs.bkp` and `dummy_test.exs.bkp`.
So you should copy and paste and remove the `dummy_` prefix and `.bkp` sufix for each file and make
your changes based on your environment configuration.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
